    The DynamicPSOSolver class definition does not need an .__init__() because it inherits from OptunitySolver and
    .__init__() does not really do anything differently for DynamicPSOSolver than it already does for OptunitySolver.

    The functions 'define_interface', 'loss_function_call', 'split_categorical' and 'convert_space' are not defined
    here as they are inherited from the parent class OptunitySolver without any changes.
